# YouTube-Data-Analysis
Data Engineer

In this Project, I have worked extensively with YouTube data, leveraging data engineering principles to manage data flows and handle large datasets effectively. My experience spans across various AWS services, where I established secure access control through IAM, streamlined data storage and retrieval with S3, and executed SQL queries on stored data using AWS Athena for impactful insights. I also developed serverless functions using AWS Lambda to automate data cleaning and transfers between S3 buckets, creating efficient workflows.
Additionally, I built a comprehensive end-to-end ETL pipeline, transforming raw data into valuable insights, and utilized AWS QuickSight for dynamic data visualization and reporting. This diverse skill set has equipped me to create scalable, insightful data solutions and drive actionable outcomes.
